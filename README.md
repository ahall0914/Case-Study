What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?

Kiva is a non-profit organization that is headquartered in San Francisco. The company allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students mainly in developing regions of the world. Their mission is "to expand financial access to help underserved communities thrive." They use the crowdfunding method to collect money from philanthropist and partner with field partners to allocate the funding to the borrowers.

Kiva competitors include companies:
• Silicon Valley Bank
• REVOLUT
• Holvi
• Quail
• Bookly
• FundThrough Express
• CrowdCube


How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?

Kiva uses technology to minimize the friction costs involved with going through third party partners to allocate the capital. They are currently in the process of working with Direct Lenders (direct payment technology partners like PayPal). This will reduce the complexity/cost in the long run. In addition, they have already developed technologies for the lenders to send money to Kiva. They are considered a FinTech as they are changing the lender-borrower relationship and making it much easier for capital to be allocated.
