# KIVA Case Study


Kiva is exemplary in itself as it tries to empower people by offering productive loans to people who would otherwise not have access to any financial product. In addition to this, it is exemplary because it uses technology for crowfunding and is now looking for a more technological approach to disbursing the loans and collecting the payments. 

Some of the strengths are 1) is the amount of money already disbursed, over $1bn, and their presence in multiple countries; 2) the crowfunding channel they alredy developed. 

The weaknesses are related to the way they disburse money through field partners and how the mechanics to disburse and collect payments in an efficient way. 

4) We believe the prognosis of the company is that they will need to make more efficient the way they work with the field partners to make sure the partners are compliant with Kiva's mission and help the borrowers
